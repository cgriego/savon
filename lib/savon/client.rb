module Savon

  # = Savon::Client
  #
  # Savon::Client is the main object for connecting to a SOAP service. It includes methods to access
  # both the Savon::WSDL and Savon::Request object.
  #
  # == Instantiation
  #
  # Depending on whether you aim to use Savon with or without Savon::WSDL, you need to instantiate
  # Savon::Client by passing in the WSDL and/or SOAP endpoint.
  #
  # Client instance with a WSDL endpoint:
  #
  #   client = Savon::Client.new :wsdl => "http://example.com/UserService?wsdl"
  #
  # Client instance with a SOAP endpoint (for using Savon without a WSDL):
  #
  #   client = Savon::Client.new :soap_endpoint => "http://example.com/UserService"
  #
  # It is recommended to not use Savon::WSDL for production. Please take a look at the documentation
  # for Savon::WSDL for more information about how to disable it.
  #
  # == Using a proxy server
  #
  # You can specify the URI to a proxy server via optional hash arguments.
  #
  #   client = Savon::Client.new :wsdl => "http://example.com/UserService?wsdl", :proxy => "http://proxy.example.com"
  #
  # == Forcing a particular SOAP endpoint
  #
  # In case you don't want to use the SOAP endpoint specified in the WSDL, you can tell Savon to use
  # another SOAP endpoint.
  #
  #   client = Savon::Client.new :wsdl => "http://example.com/UserService?wsdl", :soap_endpoint => "http://localhost/UserService"
  #
  # == Gzipped SOAP requests
  #
  # Sending gzipped SOAP requests can be specified per client instance.
  #
  #   client = Savon::Client.new :wsdl => "http://example.com/UserService?wsdl", :gzip => true
  #
  # == Savon::WSDL
  #
  # You can access Savon::WSDL via:
  #
  #   client.wsdl
  #
  # == Savon::Request
  #
  # You can also access Savon::Request via:
  #
  #   client.request
